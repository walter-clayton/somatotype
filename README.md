# SOMATOTYPE

I built this page to practice my frontend and Vanilla Javascript skills. 

This is a page that allows users to know their somatotype. 

Users put in their measurements, and the canvas outputs their results on the graph. 

The biggest difficulty was the graph. It required some knowledge in trigonometry and mathematics.
